The objective of this project is to create our own library and strengthen our basic C knowledge, including:
- Basic functions
- Dynamic memory
- Makefiles
- Libraries
- Struct and linked lists

These are a set of functions that will be a very useful tool throughout the course, to which more and more functions can be added over time.

A makefile establishes compilation rules, reduces some flags, and must contain the rules:
- $(NAME)
- all
- clean
- fclean

It should not `relink`, meaning that two successive calls to make should not result in any message other than stating that there is nothing left to do.

Upon completing this project, I noticed the reminder of the pool and how I started exploring new things, such as structs/lists and how to work with them.

## Recommendations

The recommended time frame for completing this project ranges from one week to two months, with one month being the average. 
Do not try to rush too much, it's best to go at your own pace, develop a `habit`, and `learn`.
If you get stuck on a function, it's advisable to `move on to the next one` and come back later. 
Doing the bonus is highly recommended, as you will need and use it later.
